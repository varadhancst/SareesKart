            <h1>This Is How Much A Pure Silk Saree Will Cost You</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Silk sarees are the most prized possession in a woman’s wardrobe. Much like others, I
            love investing in pure silk sarees and enhancing my closet further. When it comes to
            purchasing these ravishing sarees, an appropriate budget allocation seems like a
            tedious task. Often, ladies approach me to get an estimation on the price of
            different types of pure silk sarees.</p>
        <p>So, I decided to ease out your dilemma, and present you with an ultimate guide on the
            cost of pure silk sarees in physical and online stores.</p>

        <p><strong>How much does a pure silk saree cost? The cost of pure silk sarees begins
            from INR 2,000 and goes up to around INR 40,00,000 for the extra luxurious apparel.
            Some pure silk saree varieties like the Tussar silk are inexpensive and cost around
            INR 2,000-4,000. On the other hand, the simplest of the costly Kanjivaram pure silk
            sarees comes around INR 7,000. If you wish to have more intense Zari-work on a
            Kanjivaram saree, you will need to spend up to even several lakhs.</strong>
        <h2>What is Pure Silk?</h2>
        <p> Pure silk is a natural fiber, produced by silkworms. Being a
            worm-made product, the pure silk fibers are non-vegan and prone to decomposing
            naturally if left untreated. These fibers are processed to wash off the protein
            coating and woven to prepare the pure silk fabrics. Popular silk sarees like Kanjivaram
                and Banarasi are made from processed silk fabrics having a better
            shelf-life.</p>

        <h2>Types of Pure Silk Sarees</h2>
        <p>To get the best cost estimation, you need to know about the types of pure silk sarees
            available in the market. Most of the states in India have their variation to pure
            silk sarees. Such modifications have led to producing about 26 types of pure silk
            sarees for all the beautiful ladies. Following are the most popular kinds of pure
            silk sarees.</p>

        <h2>Why Are Silk Sarees Expensive?</h2>
        <p>From the very primitive days, silk sarees are an emblem for the higher section of the
            society. Rich women and renowned figurines used to house expensive silk attires in
            their closets from the very beginning. Even now, you cannot run away from paying a
            large amount to buy a silk saree from online and physical stores. Ever wondered why
            silk sarees are so expensive? There are two primary reasons for the massive price
            range.
        <h3><strong>Natural Fibers</strong></h3>
        <p>As you know that pure silk is a natural fiber secreted by silkworms, rearing and
            extracting silk from these worms is an expensive phenomenon. When in raw form, these
            natural silk fibers are coated with a coarse protein. Before weaving a pure silk
            fabric, the raw fibers are well-processed to remove the protein coating.
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Handcrafted Garments</strong></h3>
        <p>Silk sarees belong to Indian handicrafts. Established artisan families have been
            creating these masterpieces through generations. From handweaving to threadwork, it
            takes about 3-4 months to complete a single piece for the handcrafters. Such an
            extensive effort is bound to raise the saree prices at all stores.
        <h2>Factors Affecting the Cost of Silk Sarees</h2>
        <p>Besides the above stated generalized points, there are even more factors affecting
            the silk saree price. Though all silk sarees are costly, some of them are even
            expensive and luxurious. Are you wondering what increases the cost of silk sarees?
            Here are the factors which affect the price of these divine silk sarees.</p>
        <h3><strong>Material of Sarees</strong></h3>
        <p>Material imposes a large influence on the cost of silk sarees. The raw silk varieties
            are costlier than blended silk fabrics. The rayon-made art silk sarees are
            inexpensive mostly. On the other hand, pure silk sarees are natural fibers having a
            higher price tag.</p>
        <h3><strong>Weight</strong></h3>
        <p>The authenticity and price are often derived from the weight of silk sarees. With
            more detailed designs, a saree is likely to boast more gold threadwork, increasing
            the weight of the saree. So, a heavy-weight silk garment will cost you more than a
            light-weight one.</p>
        <h3><strong>Types</strong></h3>
        <p>The types of silk sarees determine their cost considerably. Artisans create various
            kinds of pure silk sarees differently. Some entail a dense Zari work, while some
            have a lighter Karigari on them. Simple varieties like the Tussar silk sarees are
            way more inexpensive than their Kanjivaram and Banarasi counterparts.</p>
        <h3>Borders and Pallu Karigari</h3>
        <p>borders and
            pallu-work are integral in raising the cost of pure silk sarees. Dense Karigari
            takes more time to complete than the spare silk saree threadwork. The more intricate
            detailing on the borders and pallu, the more is the cost of the silk sarees.
        <h3>Saree Body Design</h3>
        <p>Much like the borders, you will come across a price hike with detailed Karigari on
            silk saree bodies. Generally, the plain, chequered, and temple design silk sarees
            will cost you less than those with dense flora and fauna motifs.
        <h2>How Much Does a Pure Silk Saree Cost?</h2>
        <p>An artisan spends more time creating a detailed silk saree than a plain one. The
            price of a pure silk saree depends on the type that you are going to buy. Even in a
            specific silk saree variety, the price will vary according to the designs, saree
            material, and threadwork. So, let’s break down the cost of different silk sarees in
            a single place. Here, you will also find a summarized table of types of <strong>pure
                silk sarees with price</strong>.

        <h3>Kanjivaram Silk Sarees</h3>
        <p>Kanjivaram silk sarees are the pride of South India. Their sheen and softness win
            over hearts and territories. Also known as Kanchipuram sarees, these are among the
            most gorgeous and expensive silk sarees available in the market. Generally, the
            simplest Kanjivaram <strong>real silk saree price</strong> averages around INR
            7,500. But some exceptional sarees may even cost as high as INR 40 lakhs!</p>

        <p>The Kanjivaram sarees having temple designs and stripes are a bit inexpensive than
            the Butidar counterparts. As the Zari-work gets trickier, the saree prices keep
            rising continuously. Kanchipuram sarees with animals and flower motifs fall on the
            higher price points mostly.</p>
        <h3>Banarasi Silk Sarees</h3>
        <p>Banarasi silk sarees are the renowned wedding fabrics in India. These are widely
            available and have a price range of INR 5,000-30,000. Depending upon the Karigari on
            the sarees, the price points vary considerably. A detailed border and pallu take
            more artisan effort and time to get completed. On the other hand, a plain Banarasi
            saree gets finished in a short span. So, the former are kept at higher prices than
            the simple ones.</p>

        <h3>Chanderi Silk Sarees</h3>
        <p>Chanderi sarees are yet another fascinating silk sarees from India. Much like any
            other silk sarees, the price range of Chanderi varies with the Karigari and
            threadwork. While plain Chanderi silk sarees cost a bit cheaper, the embroidered
            Chanderi sarees are luxurious and expensive. On average, you might have to allocate
            a budget of INR 3,000-20,000 for purchasing a genuine Chanderi silk saree for
            yourself.</p>

        <h3>Paithani Silk Sarees</h3>
        <p>Belonging to Maharashtra, Paithani silk sarees are an integral attire in every
            Marathi household. The price of Paithani silk sarees varies with the weaving
            technique and body designing. More precisely, the more effort given to produce a
            Paithani, the more is its price range. Generally, you will be spending anywhere
            between INR 10,000-70,000 to purchase an original Paithani silk saree.</p>

        <h3>Mysore Silk Sarees</h3>
        <p>There are millions of Mysore silk saree followers in India. The decent designs and
            sober appearance of these silk sarees make it a favorite attire in a lady’s
            wardrobe. If you are willing to purchase an authentic Mysore silk saree, you might
            have to assign a budget of INR 3,000-7,000. Depending on the material and Karigari
            of Mysore silk sarees, the prices can go as high as INR 2,00,000 even.</p>

        <h2>Which Silk Saree is Most Expensive and What Causes it to be Expensive?</h2>
        <p>If you have a knack for owning expensive silk sarees in your closet, then you should
            be aware of the most luxurious silk saree variety available in the market. Mostly,
            the silk sarees cost more than other saree fabrics. However, the Kanjivaram silk
            saree is the most expensive variety in the Indian market. Surprisingly, the priciest
            silk saree is the Kanjivaram variety named Vivaah Patu which costs a whopping INR
            40,00,000.</p>
        <p>Kanjivaram silk sarees are the most gorgeous attires and take massive efforts to get
            prepared. Other silk saree varieties are way lighter and less-detailed than the
            Kanjivaram silk sarees. Unlike silk saree types like the Tussar, Kanjivaram silk
            sarees have an irresistible glaze and a well-polished surface. All of these factors
            sum up to hike the Kanjivaram <strong>pure silk saree price</strong> ranges.</p>
        <h2>Where Can I Find Cheap Pure Silk Sarees Offline in India?</h2>
        <p>After guiding you on <strong>silk sarees online shopping with price</strong>, let me
            reveal the best way to find genuine silk sarees at offline stores in India. Being
            the birthplace of silk sarees, Indian women are crazy behind these royal ensembles.
            Consequently, there are multiple hubs in India to find silk sarees at attractive

            places in Chennai. Also most famous in India for wholesale saree markets is Surat.</p>
        <p>Kanjivaram sarees originate from Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu. So, you will get the best
            saree price from the house of weavers and local showrooms. Similarly, Banarasi
            sarees belong to Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. You are more likely to get authentic and
            inexpensive deals on Banarasi sarees in the city itself. Much like these two iconic
            sarees, you can avail of attractive deals on other silk sarees by purchasing them
            from the artisans directly.</p>
        <p>Investing in silk sarees is an attractive decision only if you are well aware of the
