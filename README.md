sarees e commerce website

I developed an e-commerce website for sarees online using Python and a web framework such as Flask. The website includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to upload and delete items, as well as a login system that restricts certain actions to specific users. The website also integrates with the Stripe API to provide a secure checkout process for customers. The website includes a page with detailed information about the sarees, including images and descriptions. This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a full-stack e-commerce web application using modern technologies and good coding practices.
